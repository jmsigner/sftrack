# The proposal

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

Based on years of experience, and broad feedback from the movement
community, we aim to develop a central trajectory class to support all
stages of movement studies (pre-processing, post-processing and
analysis). We propose a `sftraj` package offering a generic and
flexible approach . The only aim of the package will be to present
this central class and basic functions to build, handle, summarize and
plot movement data. Our project relies on three complementary pillars:
a broad involvement of the movement community, a robust conceptual
data model, and a `sf`-based implementation in R. <!-- ` -->

### Definitions

*Movement* can be described by the (continuous) curve made by moving
objects (Turchin 1998, Fig. 2). In practice, this curve is sampled
(recorded) at discrete times to collect *locations*, which define
*tracking data* of the form $(x, y, z, t)$, i.e. vertices composed of
3-dimensional spatial coordinates plus the temporal coordinate. A
*track* or *path* is thus composed of a series of locations, i.e. the
"complete spatio-temporal record of a followed organism, from the
beginning to the end of observations" (Turchin 1998, Biljecki *et al.*
2013).

```{r definitions, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.cap = "Definition of elements of movement.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!t"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/definitions.png")
```

Considering the temporal autocorrelation between successive locations
as part of the movement information (Martin *et al.* 2009), we can
then defines *steps* as the straight-line segments between two
successive locations. Treating movement steps as straight lines is an
"idealization" and the most parsimonious approach (other complex
approaches exist in some fields, such as splines and Bezier curves),
but at sufficient resolution, no significant information is lost. A
sequence of steps finally forms a *trajectory*.

Movement is thus recorded by a series of locations in a track, and is
abstracted as sequential steps in a trajectory. It is important to
recognize this dual perspective between tracking data (locations) and
movement data (steps) (Fig. 2).


### Conceptual data model

To organize elements of data and how they relate to one another and to
properties of the real world entities (here a moving object), we
followed the methodology for conceptual modeling of geographic
information that is specified in the International Standards (ISO/TC
211) as described by Roswell (2011), which relies on a standard
conceptual model specified in Unified Modeling Language (UML).

In the proposed model (Fig. 3), a `Location`, i.e. tracking data of the form $(x, y, z, t)$ is implemented as an association between a `Point` (3D spatial coordinates) and a `Time` (temporal coordinate). A series (collection) of unique and ordered Locations then defines a `Track`. Two successive Locations also define a `Step`, as the elementary unit of movement data. A series (collection) of unique and ordered Steps finally defines a `Trajectory`.

Relationships between entities are not necessary symmetrical. It is
only possible to navigate downwards from Track to Locations, and from
Trajectory to Steps, as all information of a Location, or a Step, is
contained in a Track, or a Trajectory, respectively, but not the other
way around. Similarly, navigation is unidirectional between a Step and
a Location, as two successive Locations are necessary to define a
Step. However, navigation is bidirectional between a Track and a
Trajectory, as it is necessary to enforce direct correspondence of
both objects.

```{r data-model, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Proposed conceptual model for the 'sftraj' package using UML.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!t"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/conceptual-model.png")
```


### Implementation in R

The implementation aims at using existing building blocks as much as
possible, as to not reinvent the wheel, and allow to use existing
tools and functions on these building blocks. We thus propose to base
our classes on simple `data.frame`s using `sf` spatial <!-- ` -->
building blocks, structured as tidy data with observations (rows) and
variables (columns). One of the variables is the track or trajectory
column, which will store tracking data (tracks) and movement data
(trajectories), respectively (Fig. 4). The location or step is the
elementary observation and composes each row of the data
frame. Ancillary data associated to the location or the step can be
stored as additional variables.

```{r implementation, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.cap = "Proposed implementation of movement data in R. Tracking data are essentially similar, but do not have the 'Singletons' attribute.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!b"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/implementation.png")
```   

The package `sf` provides the core spatial classes: Tracking data can
be considered as `POINTS ZM`, i.e. points with longitude, latitude,
altitude, and timestamps. If the exact time of the location is known,
timestamps can be stored as `POSIXct`. Two successive `POINTS ZM`
define a `LINESTRING ZM`, i.e. the straight-line segment between two
successive locations. As the `M` coordinate has been little tested,
its relevance and usefulness will be assessed early in the project;
alternatively, timestamps will be stored separately from the
geographic data. The `tsibble` package also presents an approach to
deal with time series that will need to be further investigated.

Two new classes will be defined to store tracking data (`sftrack`) and
movement data (`sftraj`), which both inherit from `sf` and
`data.frame`.  Correspondingly, the step list-column will be of class
`sfc_TRACK` or `sfc_TRAJECTORY`, with a unique Coordinate Reference
System (CRS) and timezone in the two (constant) attributes `crs` and
`timezone`, respectively. The implementation is further complicated by
the fact that a full correspondence between a *track* and a
*trajectory* needs to be achieved, while there is no bidirectional
navigation between a Location and a Step.  An additional attributes
`Singletons` specifically for `sftraj` will thus contain locations
that do not form a step, i.e. in the case of a location surrounded by
two empty locations (e.g. failed GPS attempts).

A single `sftrack` or `sftraj` object can be a single track or
trajectory, or a set of them, sharing the same attributes (CRS and
timezone). Nesting is an essential part of the data model, as it
allows any relevant boundaries of a trajectory, such as the individual
level, the year, or a journey (movement from home to work and from
work to shopping, Biljecki *et al.* 2013), and any nested combination
of those. The package `tidyr` provides a function `nest`, which allows
to nest columns inside a data frame, and will be used to easily switch
from one level to another (e.g. from an individual representation to
an individual-year representation).

<!-- Finally, ancillary data associated to a step can be constant along the straight-line segment, vary linearly, being aggregated, or being measured at a vertex of the step (typically the start location).  -->
