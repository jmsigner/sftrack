# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.
-->

The **Project team** lists the core members of the work, who will be
instrumental in progress and completion of the
project. **Contributors** actively helped with this proposal, and
**Consulted** have been given the opportunity to provide
feedback. Signatories are listed by alphabetical order.  **Note:
relevant R packages to which people contributed are indicated within
brackets.**
