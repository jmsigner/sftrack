Description: Movement classes for tracking data and trajectories,
    relying on `sf` spatial infrastructure. Tracking data are series
    of locations with at least 2-dimensional spatial coordinates (x,y)
    and a time index (t); trajectories are the line representation of
    the path, composed by steps, i.e. the straightline segments
    connecting successive locations. `sftraj` is designed to handle
    movement of both living organisms and inanimate objects.
